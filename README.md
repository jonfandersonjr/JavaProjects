# Tetris

This game was created for a class assignment and is not intended to be copied or used for any academic purpose.

Game was made with Observer Design Pattern and features custom pieces and music. All back end development was done by course instructors and given to us. I have completed all the front end development of showing the pieces and they move and rotate - as well as implementing start/stop/pause and controls for the game.
